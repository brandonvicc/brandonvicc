# Hi there, I'm Brandon Vicchiollo 👋

## Welcome to my Profile 😄 ![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=${brandonvicc}.${brandonvicc.id})
I am an athlete with a passion for Software Engineering. My hobbies are playing basketball🏀, building web apps💻, and cooking food Gordon Ramsey would hate 🍔.

As a Software Engineer, I love using my creative mind, willingness to want to help anyone, and strategic mindset to build apps that will improve lives and change the world🗺️.
